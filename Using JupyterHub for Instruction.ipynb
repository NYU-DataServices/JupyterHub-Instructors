    "\n",
    "This session is designed for instructors and teaching assistants who need an introduction to the JupyterHub environment, an overview of the specifics of NYU's installation of JupyterHub, or just need a refresher on the helpful capabilities of the system. It presumes you have at least a general familiarity with Jupyter projects, particularly the Jupyter Notebook (if not, see our guide to Notebooks: https://guides.nyu.edu/data_management/jupyter-notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the goals are to teach:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The advantages in terms of delivering class materials and a coding environment using JupyterHub\n",
    " - How to set up the JupyterHub environement for sharing files and using autograders\n",

    "## 1.0 What is JupyterHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterHub is an open-source distribution of software that can be deployed on a server so that multiple users can access Jupyter Notebooks (nb) and other Jupyter applications from a web browser. It not only enables users to collaborate and work in teams, but also provides an option to scale up/down the resources as and when needed. Admins (and instructors to a certain extent) can add a layer of authentication and control access to all the resources. This feature of customization makes JupyterHub a useful application in educational or research settings where Jupyter Notebooks are used concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using JupyterHub to teach include:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. All students in a couse obtain access to a baseline sufficient environment to perform coursework (i.e. they aren't limited by the size/expense of their local machine).\n",
    " 2. Instructors can provide the same environment for all students, rather than troubleshoot multiple local installations on varying operating systems, etc.\n",
    " 3. Jupyter Notebooks offered on a shared JupyterHub coursesite can take advantage of all the interactive and web-first design elements, combining runnable code and instructional text in a way that a code-only or a text-only environment cannot.\n",
    " 4. It allows students to practice writing code in a realistic work environment that they are likely to encounter in a future workplace.\n",
    " 5. Instructors can take advantage of \"high-end\" options such as connecting Notebooks to databases or using it in conjunction with Spark to enable a computationally advanced environment."

    "Note that particularly if your students will need to write scripts against larger files, it is much better to offer those files via a shared folder than to have the students upload their own copy of that large file in their own root.

    "\n",
    "Found in the root of all instances (instructor and students), this is a read-only folder for students. Instructors, on the other hand, have read/write access and can upload data by switching to the <code>\\~\\/shared</code> directory and uploading/modifying/deleting data.

    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions found in the JupyterHub settings webpage under the tab \"Group Work\", summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Using the instructor instance of Jupyter Hub server, open terminal and create new directories within ~/groupshare folder, labeling the end of each folder with a random set of numbers or digits. Build as many folders as you intend to have groups. You may use the following commands as each group should get a unique folder name:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a random string that will serve as an ID\n",
    "        <code>randString=$(openssl rand -hex 32)</code>\n",
    "- Create a folder for a group with the ID\n",
    "       <code>mkdir ~/groupshare/group_1_$randString/</code>\n",
    "- Give permissions for students to read, write and execute files in that folder\n",
    "        <code>chmod 777 ~/groupshare/group_1_$randString/</code>\n",
    "- You can always see the directories you’ve created on the instructor site in the UI or type ls into the terminal. Students from their student servers cannot see any folders in this directory without knowing the exact address of the folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Send the directory path for a specific group folder to all group members, so they can access and contribute to their group work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inform students they need to read/write in their scripts to the folder using the terminal. (Example: ~/groupshare/group_1_0dfb69f079)\n",
    "- Students can also open the directory directly by adding the path you share after the “tree” stem of their JupyterHub URL. (Example: …tree/groupshare/group_1_0dfb69f079).\n",
    "\n",
    "Important considerations and limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access control is done purely based on sharing/not-sharing the name of the directory with students.\n",
    "- This directory is designed to share scripts, not data. Large data files should not be placed in groupshare. Instead, students should still ask their TA or instructor to upload a large file to the class shared directory.\n",
    "- Overall groupshare directory is limited to 10GB for all groups combined, and students have read/write access to this directory. If one group takes all the space, other groups will not be able to store anything. Instructors and TAs can always look into groupshare directory using the instructor site to see who is using too much storage. Please contact the JupyterHub team if you need to request more group share storage.\n",
