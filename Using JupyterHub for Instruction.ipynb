    "\n",
    "This session is designed for instructors and teaching assistants who need an introduction to the JupyterHub environment, an overview of the specifics of NYU's installation of JupyterHub, or just need a refresher on the helpful capabilities of the system. It presumes you have at least a general familiarity with Jupyter projects, particularly the Jupyter Notebook (if not, see our guide to Notebooks: https://guides.nyu.edu/data_management/jupyter-notebooks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the goals are to teach:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The advantages in terms of delivering class materials and a coding environment using JupyterHub\n",
    " - How to set up the JupyterHub environement for sharing files and using autograders\n",

    "## 1.0 What is JupyterHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterHub is an open-source distribution of software that can be deployed on a server so that multiple users can access Jupyter Notebooks (nb) and other Jupyter applications from a web browser. It not only enables users to collaborate and work in teams, but also provides an option to scale up/down the resources as and when needed. Admins (and instructors to a certain extent) can add a layer of authentication and control access to all the resources. This feature of customization makes JupyterHub a useful application in educational or research settings where Jupyter Notebooks are used concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using JupyterHub to teach include:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. All students in a couse obtain access to a baseline sufficient environment to perform coursework (i.e. they aren't limited by the size/expense of their local machine).\n",
    " 2. Instructors can provide the same environment for all students, rather than troubleshoot multiple local installations on varying operating systems, etc.\n",
    " 3. Jupyter Notebooks offered on a shared JupyterHub coursesite can take advantage of all the interactive and web-first design elements, combining runnable code and instructional text in a way that a code-only or a text-only environment cannot.\n",
    " 4. It allows students to practice writing code in a realistic work environment that they are likely to encounter in a future workplace.\n",
    " 5. Instructors can take advantage of \"high-end\" options such as connecting Notebooks to databases or using it in conjunction with Spark to enable a computationally advanced environment."

    "\n",
    "Note that particularly if your students will need to write scripts against larger files, it is much better to offer those files via a shared folder than to have the students upload their own copy of that large file in their own root.

    "The setup works by creating a unique directory name in the instructor's <code>\\~\\/groupshare</code> directory. That unique directory path can then be shared with the students in the designated group. For example, the instructor creates the random unique group name \"group_1_0dfb69f079\" in the groupshare folder. The students from a selected group can then write scripts accessing files in the folder <code>~/groupshare/group_1_0dfb69f079/</code>. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Instructors can specify a public or a private github repository with which students can periodically sync their class materials on JupyterHub and the destination folder will be <code>/home/jovyan/class_materials/</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by following the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Settings => Github repository**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating SSH keys and adding the same to the list of deploy keys of the repository. \n",

    "\n",
    "It is possible to create a MySQL database and use it for teaching a class from JupyterHub. This makes it easy to integrate databases with JupyterHub server while adding a layer of security by not enabling access to the database if the client is not from JupyterHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the database is created, it is recommended to create various user types and set their access permissions, typically, one for instructors with grant all access privileges and one for students with read-only permissions. This may vary based on the use-case. \n",

    "**2. Create various user types and set their access permissions**\n",

    "\n",
    "The password will be located on the settings page next to Create MySQL DB icon\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the connection is established, sql statements can be followed to create a user and set the permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>CREATE USER 'instructor'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY ‘{{instructor password}}’;</code> \n",
    "    \n",
    "<code>GRANT ALL ON mysqldb.* TO `instructor`@`%`;</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>CREATE USER 'dbreader'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password  BY ‘{{student password}}’;</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW ON `mysqldb`.* TO `dbreader`@`%`;</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is setup, the mysql package can be used to make connections and execute queries using the notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operations like create/alter schema, add/delete/select records can be performed based on the permissions the user has. \n",
