    "\n",
    "This session is designed for instructors and teaching assistant who need an introduction to the JupyterHub environment, an overview of the specifics of NYU's installation of JupyterHub, or just need a refresher on the helpful capabilities of the system. It presumes you have at least a general familiarity with Jupyter projects, particular the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the goals are to teach:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The advantages in terms of delivering class materials and a coding environment in using JupyterHub\n",
    " - Examples for how to leverage JupyterHub for interesting teaching\n",
    " - How to set up the JupyterHub environement for sharing files and using autograders\n",

    "## 1. What is JupyterHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterHub is an open-source distribution of software that can be deployed on a server so that multiple users can access Jupyter Notebooks (nb) and other Jupyter applications from a web browser. It not only enables users to collaborate and work in teams, but also provides an option to scale up/down the resources as and when needed. Admins (and instructors to a certain extent) can add a layer of authentication and control access to all the resources. This feature of customization makes JupyterHub a useful application in educational or research settings where Jupyter Notebooks are used concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using JupyterHub to teach include:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. All students in a couse obtain access to a baseline sufficient environment to perform coursework (i.e. they aren't limited by the size/expense of their local machine.\n",
    " 2. Instructors can provide the same environment for all students, rather than troubleshoot multiple local installations on varyiing operating systems, etc.\n",
    " 3. Jupyter Notebooks offered on a shared JupyterHub coursesite can take advantage of all the interactive and web-first designe elements, combining runnable code and instructional text, in a way that a code-only or a text-only environment cannot.\n",
    " 4. By installing separate sets of packages on different kernels, isntructors can easily control which libraries are available to students and switch between them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that particularly if your students will need to write scripts against larger files, it is much better to offer those files via a shared folder than to have the students upload their own copy of that large file in their own root. Students typically have 1-2 GB of storage in their instance, making it very easy for them to fill up that storage.\n",

    "\n",
    "Found in the root of all instances (instructor and students), this is a read-only folder for students. Instructors, on the other hand, have read/write access and can upload data by switching to the <code>\\~\\/shared</code> directory and uploading/modifying/deleting data. Every change here will be visible to all the students in their <code>\\~\\/shared</code> directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "The setup works by creating a unique directory name in the instructor's <code>\\~\\/groupshare</code> directory. That unique directory path can then be shared with the students in the designated group. For example, the instructor creates the random unique group name \"group_1_0dfb69f079\" in the groupshare folder. The students from a selected group can then write scripts access files in the folder <code>~/groupshare/group_1_0dfb69f079/</code>. \n",

    "If the students wish to see the contents of the shared group folder in the web browser, they would navigagte to <code>~/groupshare/group_1_0dfb69f079/tree</code>.\n",
