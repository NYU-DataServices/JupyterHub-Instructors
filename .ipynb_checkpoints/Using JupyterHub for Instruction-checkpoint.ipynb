    "\n",
    "JupyterHub is an open-source distribution of software that can be deployed on a server so that multiple users can access Jupyter Notebooks (nb) and other Jupyter applications from a web browser. It not only enables users to collaborate and work in teams, but also provides an option to scale up/down the resources as and when needed. Admins (and instructors to a certain extent) can add a layer of authentication and control access to all the resources. This feature of customization makes JupyterHub a useful application in educational or research settings where Jupyter Notebooks are used concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of using JupyterHub to teach include:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. All students in a couse obtain access to a baseline sufficient environment to perform coursework (i.e. they aren't limited by the size/expense of their local machine.\n",
    " 2. Instructors can provide the same environment for all students, rather than troubleshoot multiple local installations on varyiing operating systems, etc.\n",
    " 3. Jupyter Notebooks offered on a shared JupyterHub coursesite can take advantage of all the interactive and web-first designe elements, combining runnable code and instructional text, in a way that a code-only or a text-only environment cannot.\n",
    " 4. By installing separate sets of packages on different kernels, isntructors can easily control which libraries are available to students and switch between them.\n",

    "The setup works by creating a unique directory name in the instructor's <code>\\~\\/groupshare</code> directory. That unique directory path can then be shared with the students in the designated group. For example, the instructor creates the random unique group name \"group_1_0dfb69f079\" in the groupshare folder. The students from a selected group can then write scripts access files in the folder <code>~/groupshare/group_1_0dfb69f079/</code>. \n",

    "### Build Dynamic Lesson-Plan Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous section on using RISE to develop notebooks into slides for a lesson, you can use notebooks themselves as lesson content for use in and out of class sessions. Notebooks are foundationally an interactive tool. You can add descriptions, links, comments, Latex equations and visualization. You can use these as lecture material similar to what you can build in RISE, and have students work along on their own copies of the shared notebook.\n",

    " - From Data Services at NYU, a lesson on Harvesting Data On Web using Python link to a sample notebook on Jupyter \n",

    " - A lesson on _________ from the _______ (put one such nb in a shared/open directory to make it accessible to everyone using this)\n",

    "## 9.  Working with MySQL Databases on JupyterHub\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to create a MySQL database and use it for teaching a class from JupyterHub. This makes it easy to integrate databases with JupyterHub server while adding a layer of security by not enabling access to the database if the client is not from JupyterHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the database is created, it is recommended to create various user types and set their access permissions, typically, one for instructors with grant all access privileges and one for students with read-only permissions. This may vary based on the use-case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps for creating a database and users with different access levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Select Create MySQL DB from Setting => MySQL on the settings page**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Create various user types and set their access permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the database is created, it is recommended to create various user types and set their access permissions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, one for instructors with grant all access privileges and one for students with read-only permissions, but this may vary based on the use-case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>conda create \\{{environment name\\}}</code>\n",
    "    \n",
    "To activate the conda environment, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>conda activate \\{{environment name\\}}</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "To install mysql package if not installed already:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>conda install mysql</code> \n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to the created MySQL server with command options:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>mysql --host=mysql-tutorials-1.db --user=root --password= {{PASSWORD}} mysqldb</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "The password will be located on the settings page next to Create MySQL DB icon\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the connection is established, sql statements can be followed to create a user and set the permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>CREATE USER 'instructor'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY ‘{{instructor password}}’;</code> \n",
    "    \n",
    "<code>GRANT ALL ON mysqldb.* TO `instructor`@`%`;</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>CREATE USER 'dbreader'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password  BY ‘{{student password}}’;</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW ON `mysqldb`.* TO `dbreader`@`%`;</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is setup, the mysql package can be used to make connections and execute queries using the notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Operations like create/alter schema, add/delete/select records can be performed based on the permissions the user has. \n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to mysql_sample in the shared folder for a sample code on creating table schema and adding records to the table.\n",
